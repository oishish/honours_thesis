\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank all the students and post-docs present and past in Josh Folk's lab for all they have done for this project and for all they have taught me about being an experimentalist. Christian Olsen, Aswin Vishnu Radhan, Dr. Manabedra Kuiri, and Dr. Nik Hartman. 

I would also like to thank Tim Child and Dr. Silvia Luescher Folk, who both play very important roles in the entropy project, and without whom, this project would have never been completed. 

Of course, I would also like to thank Prof. Joshua Folk for his support and mentorship over the past few years. I consider myself lucky to have gotten the chance to work in his group.

I would also like to thank Ryan Karimi, my fellow combined physics major, I don't know how I would have gotten through these courses without you. 

And lastly, I would like to thank my parents and my sister for their support.
