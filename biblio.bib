abstract="In this introductory chapter several basic concepts, relevant for mesoscopic electron transport, will be described. The aim is to provide a basis for several of the following Chapters of this volume. We, therefore, describe in the first Section various aspects of electron quantum transport in twodimensional electron gases. This includes an estimate of typical material parameters as well as comments on the fabrication. We then describe the quantization of the conductance in point contacts and the edge state picture of the Quantum Hall effect. In the second Section we describe the theory of single---electron tunneling in systems with strong charging and Coulomb-blockade effects. Here we restrict ourselves to the simplest case where low order perturbation theory is sufficient. We first discuss metallic low-capacitance junction systems and then indicate the relevant extensions when dealing with transport through quantum dots with discrete levels. Many further, equally important aspects of mesoscopic transport can not be covered here. Examples are interference and weak localization effects, level statistics or the many body description of solids. Fortunately, some of those will be covered in the more specialized Chapter of this volume.",

	abstract = {Majorana fermions are particles identical to their own antiparticles. They have been theoretically predicted to exist in topological superconductors. Here, we report electrical measurements on indium antimonide nanowires contacted with one normal (gold) and one superconducting (niobium titanium nitride) electrode. Gate voltages vary electron density and define a tunnel barrier between normal and superconducting contacts. In the presence of magnetic fields on the order of 100 millitesla, we observe bound, midgap states at zero bias voltage. These bound states remain fixed to zero bias, even when magnetic fields and gate voltages are changed over considerable ranges. Our observations support the hypothesis of Majorana fermions in nanowires coupled to superconductors.},

@article{goldhaber-2ck,
	Abstract = {Semiconductor quantum dots ---nano-structures that tightly confine the motion of electrons ---have emerged as useful model systems for studying and manipulating the behaviour of one or a few electrons. One of the best-studied phenomena is the Kondo effect, where an isolated electron spin in a quantum dot strongly interacts with the sea of electrons in the electrodes, giving rise to a complex many-particle state. A subtly different phenomenon that is much more difficult to observe is the two-channel Kondo effect, where electrons in two electrodes are entangled with each other via their interaction with a single localized spin in a quantum dot. Unlike the conventional Kondo effect, this new effect cannot be described within the conventional picture for electron behaviour of Fermi liquids. The much sought-after two-channel Kondo effect has now been observed in quantum dots, over 25 years after it was first predicted. The system is minutely controllable at the microscopic level ---a step towards the ultimate designer semiconductor nanostructure.},
