abstract="In this introductory chapter several basic concepts, relevant for mesoscopic electron transport, will be described. The aim is to provide a basis for several of the following Chapters of this volume. We, therefore, describe in the first Section various aspects of electron quantum transport in twodimensional electron gases. This includes an estimate of typical material parameters as well as comments on the fabrication. We then describe the quantization of the conductance in point contacts and the edge state picture of the Quantum Hall effect. In the second Section we describe the theory of single---electron tunneling in systems with strong charging and Coulomb-blockade effects. Here we restrict ourselves to the simplest case where low order perturbation theory is sufficient. We first discuss metallic low-capacitance junction systems and then indicate the relevant extensions when dealing with transport through quantum dots with discrete levels. Many further, equally important aspects of mesoscopic transport can not be covered here. Examples are interference and weak localization effects, level statistics or the many body description of solids. Fortunately, some of those will be covered in the more specialized Chapter of this volume.",

Here, we report electrical measurements on indium antimonide nanowires contacted with one normal (gold) and one superconducting (niobium titanium nitride) electrode. Gate voltages vary electron density and define a tunnel barrier between normal and superconducting contacts. In the presence of magnetic fields on the order of 100 millitesla, we observe bound, midgap states at zero bias voltage. These bound states remain fixed to zero bias, even when magnetic fields and gate voltages are changed over considerable ranges. Our observations support the hypothesis of Majorana fermions in nanowires coupled to superconductors.},

@article{goldhaber-2ck,
	Abstract = {Semiconductor quantum dots ---nano-structures that tightly confine the motion of electrons ---have emerged as useful model systems for studying and manipulating the behaviour of one or a few electrons. One of the best-studied phenomena is the Kondo effect, where an isolated electron spin in a quantum dot strongly interacts with the sea of electrons in the electrodes, giving rise to a complex many-particle state. A subtly different phenomenon that is much more difficult to observe is the two-channel Kondo effect, where electrons in two electrodes are entangled with each other via their interaction with a single localized spin in a quantum dot. Unlike the conventional Kondo effect, this new effect cannot be described within the conventional picture for electron behaviour of Fermi liquids. The much sought-after two-channel Kondo effect has now been observed in quantum dots, over 25 years after it was first predicted. The system is minutely controllable at the microscopic level ---a step towards the ultimate designer semiconductor nanostructure.},

@article{afy_entropy,
	Abstract = {In condensed-matter systems, higher temperatures typically disfavour ordered phases, leading to an upper critical temperature for magnetism, superconductivity and other phenomena. An exception is the Pomeranchuk effect in 3He, in which the liquid ground state freezes upon increasing the temperature1, owing to the large entropy of the paramagnetic solid phase. Here we show that a similar mechanism describes the finite-temperature dynamics of spin and valley isospins in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene2. Notably, a resistivity peak appears at high temperatures near a superlattice filling factor of −1, despite no signs of a commensurate correlated phase appearing in the low-temperature limit. Tilted-field magnetotransport and thermodynamic measurements of the in-plane magnetic moment show that the resistivity peak is connected to a finite-field magnetic phase transition3 at which the system develops finite isospin polarization. These data are suggestive of a Pomeranchuk-type mechanism, in which the entropy of disordered isospin moments in the ferromagnetic phase stabilizes the phase relative to an isospin-unpolarized Fermi liquid phase at higher temperatures. We find the entropy, in units of Boltzmann's constant, to be of the order of unity per unit cell area, with a measurable fraction that is suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field consistent with a contribution from disordered spins. In contrast to 3He, however, no discontinuities are observed in the thermodynamic quantities across this transition. Our findings imply a small isospin stiffness4,5, with implications for the nature of finite-temperature electron transport6--8, as well as for the mechanisms underlying isospin ordering and superconductivity9,10 in twisted bilayer graphene and related systems.},

@article{pablo_entropy,
	Abstract = {In the 1950s, Pomeranchuk1 predicted that, counterintuitively, liquid 3He may solidify on heating. This effect arises owing to high excess nuclear spin entropy in the solid phase, where the atoms are spatially localized. Here we find that an analogous effect occurs in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene2--6. Using both local and global electronic entropy measurements, we show that near a filling of one electron per moir{\'e}unit cell, there is a marked increase in the electronic entropy to about 1kB per unit cell (kB is the Boltzmann constant). This large excess entropy is quenched by an in-plane magnetic field, pointing to its magnetic origin. A sharp drop in the compressibility as a function of the electron density, associated with a reset of the Fermi level back to the vicinity of the Dirac point, marks a clear boundary between two phases. We map this jump as a function of electron density, temperature and magnetic field. This reveals a phase diagram that is consistent with a Pomeranchuk-like temperature- and field-driven transition from a low-entropy electronic liquid to a high-entropy correlated state with nearly free magnetic moments. The correlated state features an unusual combination of seemingly contradictory properties, some associated with itinerant electrons---such as the absence of a thermodynamic gap, metallicity and a Dirac-like compressibility---and others associated with localized moments, such as a large entropy and its disappearance under a magnetic field. Moreover, the energy scales characterizing these two sets of properties are very different: whereas the compressibility jump has an onset at a temperature of about 30 kelvin, the bandwidth of magnetic excitations is about 3 kelvin or smaller. The hybrid nature of the present correlated state and the large separation of energy scales have implications for the thermodynamic and transport properties of the correlated states in twisted bilayer graphene.},
